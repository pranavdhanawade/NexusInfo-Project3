Online Voting System
Despite providing updates and awareness ads on social media, television, and even newspapers, our system could not encourage many to cast a vote.
This issue is only caused by not having an alternative for the current voting practices as they are proven to be time-consuming, and the most tedious job is to wait in a queue to cast your vote. The issue can be changed by developing an online voting system.
The online voting system project is designed for the Government to help the public cast their votes in the simplest way possible.
The project would include two stages.
